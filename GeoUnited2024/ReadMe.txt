This project is started for refactoring fundemental classes of SolidCNC CAD-CAM software.
For the time being the classes inside this project have Windows MFC dependencies. We want
to seperate basic geometric functionality and user interface classes. And we want to compile
this project without Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) libraries.
